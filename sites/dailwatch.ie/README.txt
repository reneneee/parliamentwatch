IMPORTANT NOTE:
We think exporting as Features won't work for CiviCRM, Direct Debit and the templating work we did.
We will need to discuss this in case we're wrong and it's still possible, or might have to dig into
it more.

For the time being, we have created a "schema" folder in which there is the Drupal database and
CiviCRM database included, which would help you to test the site.

TODO:
- Direct Debit work is for some reason now not being integrated smoothly like before when
we're trying this in the dailwatch.ie site, so we are debugging that.
- Database changes that we did for CiviCRM, we will be looking into it that how we can
do some kind of easy migration or export that you can import in your Drupal environment
on staging/production easily. If you have any advice or tip on this, feel free to let us
know please.
